## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python

Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. Confirm using:

```bash
python --version
```

### 2. Install Dependencies: Install required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install praw nltk
```

### 3. Reddit API Credentials:

- Create a Reddit app at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps.
- Select "script" as the app type, set redirect URI to http://localhost:8000.
- Create a config.py file in the project directory with:
```bash
#config.py
CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id"
CLIENT_SECRET = "your_client_secret"
USER_AGENT = "PersonaGenerator/1.0 by YourRedditUsername"
```

## Directory Setup:

- The script creates an ```output/``` directory for persona files.



##  Execution Instructions

### Run the Script:

- To generate personas for sample users (```kojied```, ```Hungry-Move-6603```):
```bash
python main.py
```


- To process a new user, edit sample_users in ```main.py```:
```bash
sample_users = ['new_username']
```




## Output:

Persona files are saved in the ```output/``` directory as ```username_persona.txt.```
Each file includes:
- Interests: Top subreddits with frequencies and citations.
- Demographics: Activity level and language complexity.
- Behavior: Most active time based on timestamps.
- Sentiment: Overall tone with citations.


## Notes

- Uses ```PRAW``` for Reddit API access and ```NLTK``` for sentiment analysis.
- Modular design separates concerns (```data extraction```, ```analysis```, ```file generation```).
- Includes error handling for robust operation.
- Sample outputs for ```kojied```, ```Hungry-Move-6603``` are included in the output directory.
